The pine tree is rather simple consisting of a cylinder, with a series of 
cones stacked on top. 

The House is also rather simple. Being made of a main box structure, i.e. the 4 
walls. Plus two triangles made with a helper function, that make up the facade of the house.
Then there are two more planes that are used to make up the roof sections of the house.
