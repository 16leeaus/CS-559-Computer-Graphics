A sphere is a good object to use as an example for enviornment mapping, because
of the way that the map interprets the enviornment. The idea is the that 
envionrment that surrounds the object is conscidered to be the side of an infinte
sphere that is infintely far away. Basically the normal vector on the fragment 
is used to determine the contents of the image at that point instead of uv mapping.
