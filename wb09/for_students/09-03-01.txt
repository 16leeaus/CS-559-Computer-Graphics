From initial viewpoint the spheres from left to right are:
    Normal map
    Normal + Diffuse map
    Bump map

You can tell the difference between the normal map and the bump map based on the way 
that the normal map can display more information about the image depth. As opposed 
to the bump map which mostly just shades the texture to give the appearance of more depth and detail.
