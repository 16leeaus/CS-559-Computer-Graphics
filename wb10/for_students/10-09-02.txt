Where did the image come from? 

I know it does not look like much, but this is a image taken of Mt. Everest and 
the surrounding Himalayas taken from on-board the international space station.

What lighting did you implement?

I implemented simple diffuse lighting in the shader.


Did you do anything beyond basic texure with diffuse lighting (explain)?
