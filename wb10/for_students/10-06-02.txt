Explain how your shader works. If your shader is based on some example, cite your source (with a link).

This is a fairly basic shader that uses the arc-tangent function over the uv coordinates to get positions and create a radial kaleidoscope like pattern. I chose to use black and white to mix the colors and the slider can change how many "stripes" are in the shader.
