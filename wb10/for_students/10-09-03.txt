Explain what your shader does and how it works.

This is a rather simple shader that will display an image, I simply used the one from before to avoid finding a new one to use and attribute properly. The sahder then overlays a pattern over the top. I could easily see this containing some kind of map overlay or information that pretains to what is below. The image below reamins the same while the overlay can be modified by the slider input.
